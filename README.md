# 📊 Superstore SQL Case Study

This project demonstrates end-to-end SQL analysis on a retail sales dataset by executing business-focused queries through MySQL and visualizing key results using Python.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview
The objective was to analyze sales performance, profitability trends, and customer behavior using structured SQL queries, supported by visual interpretation.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- MySQL
- SQLAlchemy (for stable connection)
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🔄 Data Handling Approach
A hybrid methodology was used:
- SQL was used for querying and aggregating business data
- Pandas was used for validation (null checks, duplicate detection) and visualization etc

This approach reflects real-world analyst workflows where both database-side and notebook-side processing are combined.

## 📑 Key SQL Tasks Performed
- Total sales and profit calculation
- Category-wise sales analysis
- Region-wise profit comparison
- City-wise revenue ranking
- Monthly sales trend analysis
- Most profitable sub-categories
- Top customers by profit contribution
- Identification of loss-making transactions
- Profit margin by category

## 📊 Visual Analysis (Charts Included)
The following results were also visualized for better interpretation:
- ✅ Sales by Category
- ✅ Profit by Region
- ✅ Monthly Sales Trend

These charts support business decision-making and make the analysis more insightful.
